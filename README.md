    * This application displays a list of users on multiple pages using Vanila JavaScript.
    * The list items are organized with functional programing and dynamically displayed 10 per each page.
    * I have used No obtrusive JavaScript and Progressive Enhancement for this project.
    * Search bar added and if no results a message apears.
